is something you do when you can not get a real job.That's true in starting stage on any best developers life.
Started freelancing after completing B.Tech and while waiting for joining date.That impacts me a lot for performing multiple tasks
at the same time. Gives me confidence to choose right stack for my career. Worked with startups to develop applications.
